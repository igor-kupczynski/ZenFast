# ZenFast Personal Assistant Bot - Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

ZenFast is a Telegram bot designed to serve as a personal assistant for a small, trusted group of users (friends and family). The project emphasizes simplicity, security through API key authentication, and open development as a proof-of-concept for "vibe coding" methodology.

## Problem Statement

Managing personal tasks and information through chat interfaces has become increasingly common. However, existing solutions are either:
- Too complex for small-scale personal use
- Lack privacy controls for sensitive family/friend group usage
- Require extensive setup and maintenance

ZenFast addresses these issues by providing a simple, secure, and easily extensible personal assistant bot.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Bot Owner**: Technical person who deploys and maintains the bot
- **Friends & Family**: 5-20 trusted individuals who receive API keys from the owner

### User Characteristics
- Comfortable with basic Telegram usage
- Trust relationship with bot owner
- Need for shared assistant functionality
- Privacy-conscious (prefer self-hosted solution)

## Core Requirements

### 1. Authentication & Access Control

#### 1.1 API Key Management
- **Requirement**: Users authenticate using pre-generated API keys
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Bot owner can generate API keys with expiry dates
  - Each API key grants full access to bot functionality
  - No self-service registration

#### 1.2 Authentication Flow
- **Requirement**: One-time authentication per chat/channel
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users provide API key once when first interacting with bot
  - Bot stores association between chat/channel and API key
  - Subsequent messages in same chat don't require re-authentication
  - Clear feedback when authentication succeeds/fails

#### 1.3 Key Expiration
- **Requirement**: API keys have configurable expiry dates
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Bot checks expiry on each interaction
  - Expired keys are rejected with clear message
  - No automatic renewal (owner must issue new key)

### 2. Communication Channels

#### 2.1 Direct Messages
- **Requirement**: Bot responds to private conversations
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Users can DM the bot directly
  - Same features available as in group chats

#### 2.2 Group/Channel Support
- **Requirement**: Bot works when added to groups/channels
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Bot can be added to Telegram groups/channels
  - Responds to messages directed at it
  - Multiple users in same group can authenticate independently

### 3. Shared Context

#### 3.1 Single Instance
- **Requirement**: All users share the same bot instance and context
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - No data isolation between users
  - Changes made by one user visible to all
  - Shared state across all conversations

#### 3.2 Concurrent Access
- **Requirement**: Handle multiple simultaneous users
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - Bot processes concurrent requests without crashes
  - No special conflict resolution (standard web server behavior)
  - Designed for dozens, not thousands of concurrent users

## User Stories

### Authentication Stories

**As a new user**
- I want to authenticate with my API key
- So that I can start using the bot

**Scenario**: First-time authentication
1. User sends any message to bot
2. Bot responds: "Please provide your API key to authenticate"
3. User sends API key
4. Bot validates key and expiry
5. Bot responds: "Authentication successful! You can now use the bot."

**As an existing user**
- I want the bot to remember my authentication
- So that I don't need to re-enter my API key

**As a user with expired key**
- I want clear notification when my key expires
- So that I can request a new one from the bot owner

### Usage Stories

**As a user in a private chat**
- I want to interact with the bot directly
- So that I can use it for personal tasks

**As a user in a group chat**
- I want to use the bot alongside other members
- So that we can collaborate using the assistant

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Response time: < 2 seconds for standard operations
- Concurrent users: Support up to 50 simultaneous active users
- Uptime: 99% availability (excluding planned maintenance)

### Security
- API keys stored securely (encrypted at rest)
- All communication over HTTPS/TLS
- Webhook validation for Telegram requests
- No logging of sensitive user data

### Scalability
- Designed for friends & family scale (10-50 users)
- Not optimized for thousands of users
- Single-region deployment acceptable

### Maintainability
- Open source development
- Clear documentation for bot owner
- Simple deployment process
- Minimal external dependencies

## Success Metrics

1. **Authentication Success Rate**: > 95% of valid API keys authenticate successfully
2. **Response Time**: 90% of requests handled within 2 seconds
3. **User Retention**: Active users maintain activity after 30 days
4. **Deployment Simplicity**: New instance deployable in < 30 minutes

## Out of Scope (Phase 1)

The following features are explicitly NOT included in the initial version:

1. **Bot Commands**: No specific commands or features beyond authentication
2. **Multi-tenancy**: No data isolation between users
3. **Self-Service**: No user registration or key management
4. **Advanced Permissions**: No role-based access control
5. **Data Export/Import**: No backup/restore functionality
6. **Analytics**: No usage tracking or metrics
7. **Internationalization**: English-only interface
8. **Mobile/Web UI**: Telegram-only interface

## Future Considerations

These items may be addressed in future iterations:

1. **Command Framework**: Extensible system for adding bot commands
2. **Multi-tenancy**: Optional data isolation between user groups
3. **Permission Levels**: Read-only vs. admin access
4. **Audit Logging**: Track who made what changes
5. **Backup/Restore**: Data persistence and recovery
6. **Web Dashboard**: Admin interface for key management

## Constraints

1. **Platform**: Must run on CloudFlare Workers
2. **Budget**: Minimal running costs (< $5/month)
3. **Dependencies**: Minimize external service dependencies
4. **Complexity**: Keep it simple for maintainability

## Assumptions

1. Users have Telegram accounts
2. Bot owner has CloudFlare account
3. Users trust bot owner with their data
4. Internet connectivity is generally reliable
5. Telegram API remains stable
